        Ash Wednesday & The Heroic Dose are best known for their obscure sample game, rich melodies, and Ash’s fuck-you-nicely lyricism. Her rhymes explore themes of power, social control, and self-rule while keeping the floor jumping. The Heroic Dose [Mike Balish on keyboard & Joel Handley on drums] lend their musical sensibilities.
